# OS1000

<a href="https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/zh/">OS in 1000 lines</a>
re-constructed as the source tutorial has some kind of un-elegant  
It turns out that this OS is not suitable for persistent use as it always runs into panic after a second boot.  
But anyway, a great toy for operatin system teaching, isn't it?  
Please feel free to fork this repo and modify it.
